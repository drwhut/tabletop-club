Compiling from the source code
==============================

Downloading the Godot fork
--------------------------

The first step in compiling the game from scratch is to download and compile
the game engine it runs on - `Godot <https://godotengine.org/>`_. Godot is a
free and open-source 2D and 3D game engine, and it has all the functionality we
need to make the game, except for one... 

At this point, if you've used Godot in the past, you might be wondering "wait,
if it uses Godot, can't we just download Godot from the website and import the
project?". Not quite, because we've needed to add our own little bit of code on
top of vanilla Godot, so to compile the game we need to download and compile
`a modified version of Godot <https://github.com/drwhut/godot>`_. If you're
interested as to why we've modified Godot, see :ref:`why-modify-godot`.

To download the modified Godot, you'll need to have ``git`` installed on your
computer (this will come in useful later as well). Then you can use this
command in a terminal to download the fork of Godot:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone --depth 1 --recursive https://github.com/drwhut/godot.git -b tabletop-3.4.5

.. note::

   The version number after ``-b tabletop`` refers to the Godot version the
   modified code is based on. You might need to change which version of Godot
   to download if you're planning on downloading a specific version of
   Tabletop Club, as different versions of Tabletop Club might use different
   versions of Godot.

   If you just plan on downloading the current ``master`` branch from
   Tabletop Club, then you don't need to change the above command.

   If you know which version of Tabletop Club you want to download, check the
   ``README.md`` file in it's source code and look for a command similar to the
   one above. Then, replace what comes after the ``-b`` above with what the
   ``README.md`` file says. This way, you know you're compiling a compatible
   version of Godot for the Tabletop Club version you want.


Compiling Godot
---------------

The way you compile Godot's source code is exactly how you would normally
compile Godot, the documentation of which can be found `here
<https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/development/compiling/index.html>`_.
For convenience, the instructions from the Godot documentation has been taken,
modified slightly, and put here for each platform [#godot-doc-license]_.

For all platforms, you will need *at least* the following:

* `Python 3.5+ <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_. Make sure Python is added
  to your ``PATH`` environment variable.

* `SCons 3.0+ <https://www.scons.org/>`_. Once you have Python installed, you
  can install it by opening a terminal/command prompt and running:

  .. code-block:: bash

     python -m pip install scons
  
  You can check to see whether you have installed Python and SCons correctly by
  running:

  .. code-block:: bash

     python --version
     scons --version


Compiling Godot for Windows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Requirements
""""""""""""

To compile Godot for Windows, you'll also need the following:

* `Visual Studio Community <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/>`_
  version 2017 or later. You'll need to install it with C++ support - if you've
  already installed Visual Studio without C++ support, you can re-run the
  installer and click :guilabel:`Modify` to install the C++ tools.

* `MinGW-w64 <http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php>`_ with GCC can be used as an
  alternative to Visual Studio. You'll need to configure it to use the
  ``posix`` thread model.

Compiling
"""""""""

To compile the engine, open a command prompt, change to the root directory of
the engine code (using ``cd``), and run:

.. code-block:: bash

   scons -j8 platform=windows target=release_debug

.. note::

   The ``-j8`` means that SCons will use eight threads to compile Godot.
   To make compiling faster, it's best to have this number be the same as the
   number of logical cores in your CPU.

If it compiles successfully, the result binary will be put in ``godot/bin/``
with the name ``godot.windows.opt.tools.32.exe`` or
``godot.windows.opt.tools.64.exe``. By default, SCons will build a binary
matching your CPU architecture, but this can be changed by adding ``bits=64``
or ``bits=32`` to the above command.

Creating a Visual Studio project
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you want to create a Visual Studio solution for compiling Godot instead
(which can come in handy if you plan to modify the Godot source code), you can
run SCons with the ``vsproj=yes`` parameter added:

.. code-block:: bash

   scons -j8 platform=windows vsproj=yes

Building an export template
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you want to compile an export template to export a release build of the game
from the editor, you can use the following comamnd:

.. code-block:: bash

   scons -j8 platform=windows target=release tools=no production=yes


Compiling Godot for macOS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Requirements
""""""""""""

To compile Godot for macOS, you'll also need `Xcode
<https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835>`_.

Compiling
"""""""""

Start a terminal and go to the root directory of the engine code.

To compile for Intel (x86_64) CPUs, use:

.. code-block:: bash

   scons platform=osx arch=x86_64 target=release_debug --jobs=$(sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu)

To compile for Apple Silicon (ARM64) CPUs, use:

.. code-block:: bash

   scons platform=osx arch=arm64 target=release_debug --jobs=$(sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu)

To support both architectures in a single "Universal 2" binary, run the above
two commands, then use ``lipo`` to bundle them together:

.. code-block:: bash

   lipo -create bin/godot.osx.opt.tools.x86_64 bin/godot.osx.opt.tools.arm64 -output bin/godot.osx.opt.tools.universal

If it compiles successfully, the result binary will be put in ``godot/bin/``.

To create an ``.app`` bundle like in the official builds, you need to use the
template provided in ``misc/dist/osx_tools.app``:

.. code-block:: bash

   cp -r misc/dist/osx_tools.app ./Godot.app
   mkdir -p Godot.app/Contents/MacOS
   cp bin/godot.osx.opt.tools.universal Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot
   chmod +x Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot

Building an export template
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you want to compile an export template to export a release build of the game
from the editor, you can use the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   scons platform=osx arch=x86_64 target=release tools=no production=yes --jobs=$(sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu)
   scons platform=osx arch=arm64 target=release tools=no production=yes --jobs=$(sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu)
   
   lipo -create bin/godot.osx.opt.x86_64 bin/godot.osx.opt.arm64 -output bin/godot.osx.opt.universal
   
   cp -r misc/dist/osx_template.app ./osx_template.app
   mkdir -p osx_template.app/Contents/MacOS
   cp bin/godot.osx.opt.universal osx_template.app/Contents/MacOS/godot_osx_release.64
   chmod +x osx_template.app/Contents/MacOS/godot_osx_release.64

   zip -r osx.zip osx_template.app


Compiling Godot for Linux / \*BSD
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Requirements
""""""""""""

To compile Godot for Linux and other Unix systems, you'll also need the
following:

* GCC 7+ or Clang 6+.
* pkg-config.
* X11, Xcursor, Ximerama, Xi and XRandR development libraries.
* MesaGL development libraries.
* ALSA development libraries.
* PulseAudio development libraries.

Compiling
"""""""""

To compile the engine, open a terminal, change to the root directory of the
engine code, and run:

.. code-block:: bash

   scons -j8 platform=x11 target=release_debug

.. note::

   The ``-j8`` means that SCons will use eight threads to compile Godot.
   To make compiling faster, it's best to have this number be the same as the
   number of logical cores in your CPU.

If it compiles successfully, the result binary will be put in ``godot/bin/``
with the name ``godot.x11.opt.tools.32`` or ``godot.x11.opt.tools.64``.
By default, SCons will build a binary matching your CPU architecture, but this
can be changed by adding ``bits=64`` or ``bits=32`` to the above command.

.. note::

   If you want to compile using Clang instead of GCC, use this command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      scons -j8 platform=x11 target=release_debug use_llvm=yes

Building an export template
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you want to compile an export template to export a release build of the game
from the editor, you can use the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   scons -j8 platform=x11 target=release tools=no production=yes
   strip bin/godot.x11.opt.64


Downloading Tabletop Club
-------------------------

To download the Tabletop Club Godot project, you can either download a
compressed copy of the source code for a particular version from the `releases
<https://github.com/drwhut/tabletop-club/releases>`_ page on GitHub and extract
it, or if you're feeling very adventurous, you can download the latest source
code on the ``master`` branch by running this command:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/drwhut/tabletop-club.git


Downloading the WebRTC GDNative plugin
--------------------------------------

Since the multiplayer for Tabletop Club uses WebRTC, you'll need to download
the WebRTC plugin for Godot. You can follow these instructions to setup
the plugin:

1. Download the latest release (not a pre-release!) of the plugin from
   `the repository <https://github.com/godotengine/webrtc-native/releases>`_.
   Make sure to download the ``webrtc-native-release`` file rather than the
   ``webrtc-native-debug`` file.

2. Open the compressed file, and place the ``webrtc/`` folder into
   ``tabletop-club/game/``. Afterwards, there should be a file at
   ``tabletop-club/game/webrtc/webrtc.tres``.


Running Tabletop Club in the Godot editor
-----------------------------------------

To open Godot's project manager, run the executable you compiled in
``godot/bin/``. You can then import the project by clicking the
:guilabel:`Import` button and selecting the ``tabletop-club/game/project.godot``
file. Now you can open the project and play the game by pressing the play
button in the top-right corner (or by pressing F5)!

At this point, you can modify the game to your heart's content! Have a look at
the scenes and scripts, try tweaking things here and there, or maybe try and
add some stuff of your own?


Exporting the game
------------------

You can export the game with the editor to make it so you don't need to run the
game through the editor to play it. Here's how you can export the project:

1. Click on :guilabel:`Project` > :guilabel:`Export...`
2. In the pop-up, click :guilabel:`Add...`, and select your platform.
3. In the menu on the right, set the debug template to point to the editor
   executable, and if you made a release template, set that as well.

   .. note::

      If you are on macOS, then you will need to disable library validation as
      shown below. This is in order to prevent the system from checking the
      WebRTC library, which stops it from loading.

      .. image:: osx_disable_library_validation.png
         :scale: 50%

4. Click :guilabel:`Export project`, choose where you want to export the
   project and whether you want to export a debug or a release binary, then
   click :guilabel:`Save`.
5. Copy the ``tabletop-club/assets/`` folder next to the exported binary, so
   the game has assets to import.

   .. note::

      On macOS, you'll need to put this folder inside the ``.app`` package, 
      specifically in ``Tabletop Club.app/Contents/Resources``.

Now, you should be able to launch the exported executable and play the game
directly!


.. _why-modify-godot:

Why did you fork Godot?
-----------------------

There's actually just one reason for this: there was a feature that I knew
existed in Godot, but it was not exposed to the in-built scripting language
GDScript, and the functionality wasn't included in release templates.

When the game starts, the first thing it does is it scans certain folders for
asset packs, and if it finds any, the game will then import assets from those
packs. The way the game imports assets is almost identical to how Godot imports
assets in the editor. It's possible because of `a custom module
<https://github.com/drwhut/tabletop_club_godot_module>`_ I made that takes
advantage of the importing code that already exists for the editor, and it
allows me to import assets like textures and 3D models from anywhere on the
filesystem using just one function in GDScript.

However, a problem occured when compiling Godot with this module as a release
template - the compiled editor code was not included in the release templates,
so the custom module had no idea what "importing" meant. This meant I had to
tweak some of the editor code and the SCons build script to include the
importing code in release builds, while stopping compiler/runtime errors from
happening since the code was suddenly disconnected from the rest of the editor.
