## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The value of die faces can now be text, as well as numbers. (#209)
- Added a "Donate" button to the main menu that opens `ko-fi.com/drwhut` in the
  default browser.

### Changed

- The format of the `face_values` property has changed from `VALUE: ROTATION` to
  `ROTATION: VALUE`, allowing for multiple faces of a die to have the same
  value.
- Updated documentation domain from `tabletop-club.readthedocs.io` to
  `docs.tabletopclub.net`.
- Replaced the "itch.io" button on the main menu with a "Website" button that
  opens `tabletopclub.net` in the default browser.
- Combined the "Discord" and "Matrix" buttons on the main menu into one
  "Community" button that opens `tabletopclub.net/community` in the default
  browser.

### Removed

- The AssetDB no longer requires that the `face_values` property has the same
  number of elements as the number of faces on the die.
